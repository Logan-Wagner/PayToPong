    <h2>
        Ideas Behind Pay for Pong 
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented many different techniques used by industry professionals in the making of this website in order to highlight these techniques and make the user more aware of them in the hopes of lowering the chances of video game addiction. 
<br>
<br>
Firstly, despite the fact that Pong is a fairly straightforward and "easy" game, when the user initially joins the website and starts playing, the game is nearly impossible to win. We have made that possible through HOW DID WE DO THAT. The user must then use their in-game coins in order to purchase power-ups and upgrades in order to make their chances of winning somewhat reasonable.
<br>
<br>
These power-ups and upgrades are not easy to obtain though. The game starts with only two one-time-use power-ups unlocked, so that the user is forced to purchase more through the Shop if they want to continue playing. That being said, the user only starts off with a certain amount of in-game coins. Once these dwindle down to zero, then they have a few options for getting more. On each screen of the game, there is the option for the user to watch a few "ads" which will give them a certain amount of coins depending on how long the ad is. But who has the time to be watching ads? Thus, we made another option where the user can use real money in order to purchase more in-game coins. (But not really because we cannot accept real money on our website. So when the user clicks on the button to input real money, we just tell them that we tricked them and that they shouldnâ€™t be spending their money like this). 
<br><br>
In addition to the regular gameplay of Pong, we also added a customization factor to the game, where the user can spend in-game coins in order to change the colors of the aspects of the game.
<br><br>
Overall, we implemented these techniques in order to maximize the amount of time spent on our game, which simulates what video game designers do in industry. In the top right hand corner of this screen, you can see how long we got you to play our game for. Does the number surprise you?
