    <h2>
        Ideas Behind Pay for Pong 
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented many different techniques used by industry professionals in the making of this website in order to highlight these techniques and make the user more aware of them in the hopes of lowering the chances of video game addiction. 
<br><br>
Firstly, despite the fact that Pong is a fairly straightforward and "easy" game, when the user initially joins the website and starts playing, the game is nearly impossible to win due to the nature of the A.I. that the user is playing against and the speed of their paddle and ball. The user must use their in-game coins in order to purchase power-ups and upgrades in order to make their chances of winning somewhat reasonable.
<br><br>
These power-ups and upgrades are not easy to obtain though. The game starts with only two one-time-use power-ups unlocked, so that the user is forced to purchase more through the Shop if they want to continue playing. That being said, the user only starts off with a certain amount of in-game coins. Once these dwindle down to zero, then they have a few options for getting more. On each screen of the game, there is the option for the user to watch a few "ads" which will give them a certain amount of coins depending on how long the ad is. But who has the time to be watching ads? Thus, we made another option where the user can use real money in order to purchase more in-game coins. (But not really because we cannot accept real money on our website. So when the user clicks on the button to input real money, we just tell them that we tricked them and that they shouldn't be spending their money like this). 
<br><br>
In addition to the regular gameplay of Pong, we also added a customization factor to the game, where the user can spend in-game coins in order to change the colors of the aspects of the game.
<br><br>
Overall, we implemented these techniques in order to maximize the amount of time spent on our game, which simulates what video game designers do in industry. In the top right hand corner of this screen, you can see how long we got you to play our game for. Does the number surprise you?

    <h3>
        Addictive Video Game Design in Industry
    </h3>
    <p>
        We are not the only ones doing this to you! Video games that are currently in production are also using these techniques in order to “trick” users into spending more time on their games and making more impulsive financial decisions. 
        <br><br>
According to the Unity Game Report from 2022, mobile games with ads have higher retention rates than games without them and following this, in-app purchases and ad revenue on mobile games grew by around 30% in 2021, with 2021 being a record year for the most money players have spent on games. In addition to this, the report states that over 90% of studios use third-party player engagement services and 88% use third-party in-app purchase services. So gaming companies are utilizing ads in order to help their player retention rates and also increase their revenue. There are lots of articles such as <a href="https://blog.unity.com/games/improve-player-retention-with-in-game-ads">this</a> one from Unity that describe in detail how to utilize in-game ads to help users advance through your game so that you can increase player retention and also maximize your revenue.
<br><br>
In addition to ads, game companies are hiring psychologists in order to “analyze data and make sure their products are as effective as they can be” (Clay 2012). Psychologists use player data and surveys in order to understand how the game makes players feel and how to increase “engagement, motivation, reinforcement, attention and other topics dear to psychologists” (Clay 2012). Studies done by researcher Nick Yee on Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) has shown that these games rely on rewards cycles, the network of relationships that a player develops, and immersive environments in order to maximize the amount of time spent on these games (Yee 2002). In addition to this, these games can help fulfill aspects of users' lives that are missing in real life due to low self esteem, stress, poor self image, and lack of control over their own lives by being an outlet for the user (Yee 2002). MMORPGs give the user control of what they look like in the game and give them a sense of feeling valued and making a difference (Yee 2002). Thus, understanding the players is an important part of creating an addictive game because knowing how the users think and what the users need from the game will greatly impact the amount of time that they spend playing it.
<br><br>
Another example of these techniques in action is the popular mobile game Candy Crush, which utilizes a “near miss” technique that has been used by gambling companies which relies on user aggravation in order to have people make impulse purchases (Viterbi Conversations in Ethics 2021).  
<br><br>
And video game companies are not the only people using these techniques either. Companies such as eBay and credit card companies are using techniques such as challenges between users, bars showing progress towards a goal, and virtual currency in order to engage customers (Clay 2012). This shows how much of an impact video game design has on the way that we live and on the world overall!

    <h4>
        Harms of Video Game Addiction
    </h4>
    <p>
        Video game addiction is a very serious problem, as it causes harm to both the physical and mental health of the person with the addiction. 
        <br><br>
        Anxiety and depression are common in people who are addicted to video games. In addition to this, children are playing more indoor activities versus outdoor activities compared to their parent's generation, which also corresponds to a negative relationship between exercise and time spent gaming that can lead to risk factors such as obesity, diabetes and coronary artery disease (Mohammed 2023). Also, according to the American Medical Association, approximately 90% of young Americans play computer games, and 15% of these gamers (i.e., over five million children) could be considered addicted (Mohammed 2023). This is a serious issue. Studies have shown that video game addiction and internet gaming disorders in students causes them to play video games for much longer and they usually miss more classes, have lower grades, and get less sleep compared to students without these disorders (Mohammed 2023). 
        <br><br>
        The primary consequence of gaming addiction is "time loss", with a study of "280 video game players" experiencing time loss 82% of the time. However, half of those respondents reported that this time loss was a good thing (Wood 2008). So not only are these addictions causing both children and adults to have trouble with their health, they also have very real negative consequences on their lives, which they may be blind to during the peak of their addiction. These issues have become so bad that the first video game addiction detox center opened up in 2006 in the Netherlands and more have been opening around the world since then (Mohammed 2023). Overall, video game addiction needs to be taken very seriously due to the fact that it can ruin people's lives.

    <h5>
        Some Closing Thoughts
    </h5>
    <p>
        Keith Bakker, the director of Amsterdam-based Smith and Jones Addiction Consultants and their treatment center, noted that “although video games may look innocent, they can be as addictive as gambling or drugs and just as difficult of a habit to break” (Mohammed 2023). 
        <br><br>
        This point, along with the information contained above, begs the question of whether or not the addictive design of video games is even ethical to begin with. As we have seen, video game addiction can have very real negative consequences on the users, and yet the creators of video games are still using these tequniques in the games that they produce. 
        <br><br>
        Should we as users just accept this? What can we do to create change and make games that are both healthy for the users and yet still profitable for the creators of the games? Is that even a possibility? 
        <br><br>
        We'll let you think about it and decide...
